# Outreach

Me (baffled?!) by something someone said at our Outreach booth at Space Day in Balboa Park.

I have been lucky to have been able to do so much community and academic outreach work over the course of grad school. While I try to go to free form events, there were two solid pillars that I worked on quite extensively. 

## Young Physicists Program (YPP)

The [Young Physicists Program](https://ypp.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego brings middle schoolers from San Diego county to the UC San Diego physics department once a month, every month over the course of the academic year and each month we discuss activities, experiments, labs, demos and a talk by a guest lecturer (usually provided by the faculty at UCSD). I ran YPP for ~ 6 years with some wonderful friends (on mostly, off during Covid). 

# Cosmic Tours

The [Cosmic Tours Planetarium](https://oirlab.ucsd.edu/planetarium.html) Program is a portable planetarium program run and managed by my thesis advisor Shelley Wright at UC San Diego. The planetarium serves all of San Diego county for public outreach, and also assists classes at UC San Diego with live shows. Over the course of ~3 years, I presented something like ~40 shows for public, students all the way from elementary through high school, and the occasional college class. It was insanely fun and incredibly rewarding.

For a full demonstration of the planetarium capability, at one point we simultaneously projected every coordinate system in the sky at the same time. Absolute anarchy. No notes. This was during down time no students were harmed in the projection of this image although a couple of grad students might have felt queasy.
