# Astrophotography

I have a small 6 inch telescope, but all the photography I have here is actually from my phone, which is the Pixel 4a. It has a pretty sick sensor and more importantly software for astrophotography.


All pictures thus far were taken on Mt. Laguna, which is about an hour long drive from San Diego.

This is one of my favorites. You can see Jupiter rising between two trees, there's Andromeda in the shot, and there's a trail close to Jupiter which is neither a plane, nor Starlink satellites, because it is too short for a 4 minute exposure.

Straight up zenith. Just set the phone on top of the car and hoped it'll work out, can see Andromeda again in the bottom right! (You can tell I have a favorite target)

Pleiades, part of the Taurus constellation. Can you spot Aldeberan? Or the Hyades cluster?

The Milky Way! Tiny airplane passing at the bottom!
