# Welcome!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Arizona, working with the [UASAL group](https://uasal.github.io/) since Fall 2024, where I am currently working on Point Spread Function Reconstruction for Space based telescope in addition to developing Machine Learning based Phase Retrieval tools for future telescopes. I also work on the interaction of radio jets with the larger circumgalactic environments of galaxies and have used data from the Keck telescopes in conjunction with VLA, ALMA, Hubble, Spitzer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Chandra in the past for my work. I am currently working on combining the new LOFAR data with existing datasets!

Between 2017 and 2024 I was a graduate student at UC San Diego. I worked with two different research groups for my dissertation, the [OIRLab](https://oirlab.ucsd.edu/) and the [APOLLO](https://tmurphy.physics.ucsd.edu/apollo/) group. Before this, I completed an Integrated MSc. degree in Physics from [University of Mumbai Center for Excellence in Basic Sciences](https://www.cbs.ac.in/). I also worked at Aarhus University for 5 months in 2016 for my masters thesis with Professor Hans Fynbo, for which I used their resident 5 MeV van de Graaf accelerator.

Outside my research, I enjoy spending time doing Physics outreach and have been fortunate to have run the [Young Physicists Program](https://ypp.ucsd.edu/) and been a part of the [Cosmic Tours Portable Planetarium](https://oirlab.ucsd.edu/planetarium.html) program at UC San Diego. In my free time, I love to cook, play video games with friends or read a book (lately leaning non fiction).
