#  Personal Website 
I designed this website as a professional basecamp to have an online presence about all things work. 

## Credits

The website is based on the cvless design (https://cvless.netlify.app) and draws in one way or another from the following projects:

-   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
-   [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)
-   [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com/)
-   [Open Color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/)
-   [Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)
-   [Piazzolla](https://piazzolla.huertatipografica.com/)
-   [Poole](https://getpoole.com/)
