## Circumgalactic Medium (CGM)

I use the Keck telescopes to study the Circumgalactic Medium CGM) of galaxies that are at a redshift (z) = 2, which means light we see today left these galaxies something around 3 billion years after the Big Bang. The circumgalactic medium is like the atmosphere of a galaxy. You can look at Earth's atmosphere, see all this oxygen here and realize that oxygen doesn't last very long in the atmosphere, something must be producing it, which it is (all life on earth!), something very similar happens with the CGM. By looking at the contents of the CGM, you can tell what kind of star formation has happened in the galaxy in the past, and maybe what is happening right now!

I use the Keck telescopes for my work, and use an instrument called the Keck Cosmic Web Imager to image the CGM around galaxies. Keck I and Keck II are two of the largest optical and infrared telescopes in the world. They are both segmented telescopes, which means they aren't one giant monolithic mirror, but made up of hexagonal segments that combine to form a large mirror.
